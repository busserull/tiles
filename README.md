## A simple game called 'Tiles'
Tiles is a minesweeper game for one or two people.

# Description
The game lets the player choose between Singleplayer,
Multiplayer host, or Multiplayer client - as well as
choosing a name.

Both modes, single- and multiplayer are almost done,
though some features remain unimplemented. There is
also a little bit of polish to be done.

# Coming features
* Change board size
* File statistics
* Sudden-death for multiplayer
* Store last used name and IP/port

# 3rd party components
SFML is required as it is used for both graphics and
network. Apart from that, the only other libraries used
are either part of the C++ standard or written for
this game.

The two fonts used in the game - Bebas Neue, and Sansation
are both freeware, but dontations can be made on
fontfabric.com/bebas-neue and dafont.com/sansation.font
